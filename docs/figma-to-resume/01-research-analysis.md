## MCP Figma Technology Overview

### What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

MCP is a standardized protocol that enables AI agents to access external data sources and tools. For Figma integration, it allows AI coding assistants to:
- Fetch design data directly from Figma files
- Extract layout information, components, and styling
- Convert designs to code with high fidelity
- Maintain design system consistency

### Available MCP Figma Servers

Based on research, there are several MCP Figma servers available:

#### 1. **Framelink Figma MCP Server** (Recommended)
- **Popularity**: 467.8K downloads, 8.8K GitHub stars
- **Maturity**: Most stable and widely adopted
- **Features**: 
  - Designed for Cursor and other AI-powered coding tools
  - Simplifies Figma API responses for better AI understanding
  - Active community and support
- **NPM Package**: `figma-developer-mcp`
- **Pros**: Proven track record, excellent documentation, optimized for coding workflows
- **Cons**: Third-party dependency

#### 2. **Figma Dev Mode MCP Server** (Official)
- **Publisher**: Figma (Official)
- **Status**: Recently released in beta
- **Features**:
  - Integrates directly with Figma's desktop app
  - Provides design-informed code generation
  - Supports SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport
- **Pros**: Official support, latest features, direct integration
- **Cons**: Beta status, requires desktop app

#### 3. **Talk to Figma MCP** (Interactive)
- **Features**:
  - Enables bidirectional communication with Figma
  - Allows creating and manipulating design elements
  - Uses WebSocket bridge for real-time interaction
- **Pros**: Full bidirectional control
- **Cons**: More complex setup, primarily for manipulation rather than extraction

### Recommendation
**Use Framelink Figma MCP Server** for both use cases due to its stability, proven track record, and optimization for coding workflows.

## Use Case 1: Developer Workflow Integration

### Objective
Enable development team and AI agents to quickly adapt code using existing Figma designs for rapid feature development and updates.

### Current Developer Workflow Challenges
1. **Manual Design Interpretation**: Developers manually inspect Figma designs and write code
2. **Context Switching**: Constant switching between Figma and IDE
3. **Design Fidelity Issues**: Visual inconsistencies between design and implementation
4. **Time Consumption**: 2-4 hours to implement a complex component from design

### Proposed Enhanced Workflow

#### Before (Traditional)
```
Design → Manual Inspection → Code Writing → Review → Iteration
⏱️ 2-4 hours per component
```

#### After (MCP-Enhanced)
```
Design URL → AI Agent → Generated Code → Quick Review → Deployment
⏱️ 15-30 minutes per component
```

### Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Server Setup and Configuration

**Recommended Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Framelink Figma MCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-developer-mcp", "--figma-api-key=YOUR_FIGMA_API_KEY", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Team Integration Guidelines

**Design Handoff Process:**
1. **Designers**: Share Figma links with specific frame/component references
2. **Developers**: Use MCP-enabled IDE (Cursor, VS Code with Copilot)
3. **AI Agents**: Automatically fetch design context and generate code

**Prompting Best Practices:**
```typescript
// Example effective prompt:
"Generate a React component using CSS Modules based on this Figma design: 
https://figma.com/file/example?node-id=123:456

Requirements:
- Use TypeScript
- Follow kebab-case naming conventions
- Use CSS Modules (not Tailwind)
- Make it responsive
- Include proper interfaces"
```

#### 3. Integration with Existing Project

**CSS Modules Integration:**
```typescript
// Generated component structure
// src/components/new-feature/new-feature.tsx
import styles from './new-feature.module.css';

export const NewFeature = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <h2 className={styles.title}>Generated from Figma</h2>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Project Rules Integration:**
```markdown
// .cursor/rules.md additions
- Always use CSS Modules for styling generated from Figma designs
- Follow kebab-case naming conventions for generated components
- Preserve responsive design patterns from Figma
- Use existing design tokens when available
```

### Expected Benefits

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Component Development Time | 2-4 hours | 15-30 minutes | 75-87% faster |
| Design Fidelity Score | 70-80% | 90-95% | 15-25% improvement |
| Context Switching | 10-15 times/hour | 2-3 times/hour | 80% reduction |
| Code Consistency | Manual review needed | Automatic adherence | 100% consistency |

## Use Case 2: User Figma Upload Feature

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements

#### Response Time Targets
- **Figma API calls**: < 2 seconds
- **Design parsing**: < 3 seconds
- **Code generation**: < 1 second
- **Total user experience**: < 8 seconds

#### Scalability Considerations
- **Figma API Rate Limits**: 1000 requests/hour per token
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for frequently accessed designs
- **Background Processing**: Queue system for large designs
- **CDN**: Static asset caching for generated components

### Error Handling Strategy

#### Common Error Scenarios
1. **Invalid Figma URLs**: Clear validation and user feedback
2. **API Rate Limiting**: Graceful degradation and retry logic
3. **Permission Denied**: User-friendly error messages
4. **Parsing Failures**: Fallback to manual input option
5. **Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

#### Error Recovery
```typescript
// Example error handling pattern
try {
  const designData = await FigmaAPI.fetchDesignData(fileId, nodeId);
  return await FigmaToResumeParser.parseDesign(designData);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.status === 403) {
    throw new Error('Please ensure the Figma file is publicly accessible');
  } else if (error.status === 429) {
    throw new Error('Too many requests. Please try again in a few minutes');
  } else {
    throw new Error('Failed to process Figma design. Please try again');
  }
}
```

### Database Schema Updates

#### New Tables Required
```sql
-- Store Figma-specific metadata
CREATE TABLE figma_resume_metadata (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  resume_id UUID REFERENCES resumes(id),
  figma_file_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  figma_node_id VARCHAR(50),
  design_name VARCHAR(255),
  generated_jsx TEXT,
  generated_css TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Index for faster lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_figma_metadata_resume_id ON figma_resume_metadata(resume_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_figma_metadata_file_id ON figma_resume_metadata(figma_file_id);
```

## Security & Privacy

### API Key Management

#### Best Practices
1. **Server-side Only**: Never expose API keys in client-side code
2. **Environment Variables**: Store in secure environment configuration
3. **Key Rotation**: Implement regular key rotation schedule
4. **Access Logging**: Monitor API key usage and detect anomalies

#### Implementation
```typescript
// lib/figma-config.ts
export const FigmaConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.FIGMA_API_KEY,
  baseUrl: 'https://api.figma.com/v1',
  timeout: 30000,
  rateLimits: {
    requests: 1000,
    period: 3600000 // 1 hour
  }
};

// Validation
if (!FigmaConfig.apiKey) {
  throw new Error('FIGMA_API_KEY environment variable is required');
}
```

### Data Privacy Compliance

#### User Consent
- **Clear Disclosure**: Inform users about Figma data access
- **Opt-in Model**: Require explicit consent for Figma integration
- **Data Retention**: Implement clear data retention policies
- **Right to Deletion**: Allow users to remove Figma-generated content

#### GDPR Compliance
```typescript
// Example consent tracking
interface FigmaConsentRecord {
  userId: string;
  consentDate: Date;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  consentVersion: string;
  dataTypes: string[];
}
```

### Access Control

#### Figma File Permissions
1. **Public Files Only**: Initially support only public Figma files
2. **Permission Validation**: Verify user access before processing
3. **Team Files**: Future support for team-accessible files
4. **Audit Trail**: Log all Figma file access attempts
