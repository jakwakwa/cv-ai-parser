OVERVIEW CONTEXT FOR ALL TICKETS
We are converting from Tailwind CSS to CSS Modules following project rules that mandate:
- No Tailwind usage (gradual removal planned)
- CSS Modules for all styling
- Kebab-case naming for files
- No breaking changes or regressions
- Preserve all existing functionality, responsive design, and custom color theming
