# Migrating database
Whenever you make changes to your database that are reflected in the Prisma schema, you need to manually re-generate Prisma Client to update the generated code in the node_modules/.prisma/client directory.


npx prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma --script > prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql

Review the SQL migration file to ensure everything is correct.

Next, mark the migration as applied using prisma migrate resolve with the --applied argument.

npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 0_init
`prisma generate`
To make further changes to your database schema, you can update your Prisma schema and use `prisma migrate dev` to apply the changes to your database.
