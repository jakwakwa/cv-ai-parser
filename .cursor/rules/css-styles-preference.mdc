- always implement css module for applying or modifying css styles
- never use tailwindCss, even if its in pre-existing code
- eventual and gradual refactoring will be implemented to remove tailwind. So there's no point in adding more. 
- when busy with any task and you encounter tailwind classes in jsx code, please ask the user if they would like it remove and convert into the preffered css module pattern
