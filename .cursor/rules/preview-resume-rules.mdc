## Resume Display Theming

- **Theme Colors and Variables:** The themes, color variable values, and color variable names within the project should **never be changed** unless explicitly requested by the user. These include, but are not limited to, variables defined in `styles/01-settings/_themes.css` or any `customColors` passed to resume components.

## Resume Content (id="resume-content")

- **User-Generated Content Area:** The content inside the HTML element with `id="resume-content"` in `src/containers/resume-display/resume-display.tsx` is explicitly using user-generated styles and is an output of our parsing system.
- **Strictly No Modifications:** AI agents **MUST NOT** change any line of code inside the `<div id="resume-content">` element or any of its child components that directly render parsed resume data (e.g., `ProfileHeader`, `ContactSection`, `ExperienceSection`, `EducationSection`, `CertificationsSection`, `SkillsSection`).
- **Prior Approval Required:** If any modification to this area is deemed absolutely necessary, the AI agent **MUST ask the user for explicit approval** before making any changes. This includes styling, structure, or content within these sections.
