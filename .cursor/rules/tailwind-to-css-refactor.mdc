During the Tailwind to CSS Modules refactoring, agents MUST adhere to the following:
1.  **Prioritize CSS Modules:** All new styling or modifications to existing styles MUST use CSS Modules. DO NOT introduce new Tailwind classes.
2.  **Existing Tailwind Classes (Outside Active Refactoring):** If Tailwind classes are encountered in files that are *not* currently part of an active refactoring ticket, the agent MUST ask the user if they would like to convert these classes to CSS Modules.
3.  **Active Refactoring (Ticket Specific):** If the agent is working on a file explicitly covered by an active refactoring ticket, it MUST proceed with the conversion of Tailwind classes to CSS Modules as per the refactoring plan.
4.  **No Breaking Changes:** Ensure all changes avoid introducing breaking changes or regressions. Preserve existing functionality and visual appearance.
