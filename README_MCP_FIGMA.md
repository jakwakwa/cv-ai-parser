# MCP Figma Integration - Project Documentation

## üìã Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance for integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) Figma technology into your AI-powered resume generation project. The integration supports two key use cases that will significantly enhance both developer productivity and user experience.

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Developer Workflow Enhancement
**Objective**: Enable your development team to rapidly generate code from existing Figma designs using AI agents.

**Key Benefits**:
- ‚ö° **Rapid Prototyping**: Convert Figma designs to production-ready React components in seconds
- üé® **Design Fidelity**: Maintain pixel-perfect accuracy with design intent preservation
- üîÑ **Seamless Workflow**: Direct integration with Cursor IDE and other AI-powered coding tools
- üìè **Consistency**: Automatic adherence to project naming conventions and CSS Modules

### 2. User Figma Upload Feature
**Objective**: Allow users to upload Figma design links during resume creation and automatically generate resumes based on the design structure.

**Key Benefits**:
- üé® **Custom Designs**: Users can create unique resume layouts in Figma
- ü§ñ **Automated Parsing**: AI extracts resume sections and content automatically
- üì± **Responsive Output**: Generated code maintains responsive design patterns
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Data Integration**: Seamlessly connects parsed user data to design elements

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Use Case 1 (Developer Workflow)

1. **Get Figma API Token**
   ```bash
   # Visit https://www.figma.com/settings ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Personal access tokens
   # Create token and add to .env.local
   echo "FIGMA_API_KEY=your_token_here" >> .env.local
   ```

2. **Configure MCP Server**
   ```bash
   # Copy example configuration
   cp .cursor/mcp.json.example .cursor/mcp.json
   # Replace YOUR_FIGMA_API_KEY with your actual token
   ```

3. **Test Integration**
   ```bash
   # In Cursor Composer, try:
   # "Generate a React component from this Figma design: [FIGMA_URL]"
   ```

### For Use Case 2 (User Upload Feature)

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk figma-api cheerio
   ```

2. **Add Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   echo "FIGMA_API_KEY=your_figma_api_key_here" >> .env.local
   ```

3. **Implement Changes**
   - Follow the detailed implementation guide
   - Add new API routes and update ResumeUploader component
